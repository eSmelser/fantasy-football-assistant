# Fantasy Football Draft Assistant - Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision
Build a professional-grade fantasy football draft assistant with AI-powered recommendations, clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and modern web interface.

## 📋 Current State Assessment
- ✅ Basic functionality working (CLI draft assistant)
- ✅ Research data compiled (8,997+ mock drafts, injuries, bye weeks)
- ✅ AI recommendation engine prototype
- ❌ Code needs refactoring for maintainability
- ❌ No input validation or error handling
- ❌ No tests or documentation
- ❌ No version control

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation & Code Quality ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Project Structure & Git Setup ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Create professional directory structure
- ✅ Set up virtual environment and requirements.txt
- ✅ Create comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Push to GitHub with initial commit

### 1.2 Code Architecture Refactor 🔄 PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- ✅ Split monolithic draft_assistant.py into modules:
  - ✅ `models/` - Data models and database operations (Player class complete)
  - ⏳ `services/` - Business logic and AI recommendations (TODO)
  - ⏳ `cli/` - Command-line interface (TODO)
  - ✅ `utils/` - Helper functions and validation (PlayerSearch, validation complete)
- ✅ Implement clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Add proper error handling and logging
- ⏳ Create configuration management (TODO)

### 1.3 Input Validation & UX ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Player name autocomplete/fuzzy matching (PlayerSearch class)
- ✅ Typo prevention and "did you mean?" suggestions
- ✅ Input validation for all commands (comprehensive validation.py)
- ✅ Better error messages and help system (ValidationError with suggestions)
- ⏳ Command history and undo functionality (TODO - Phase 2)

- [ ] Documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Clean git history with semantic commits

### User Experience  
- [ ] Zero-typo player entry (autocomplete)
- [ ] Sub-second recommendation generation
- [ ] Intuitive command interface
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Mobile-friendly web interface

### Performance
- [ ] <100ms database queries
- [ ] <500ms AI recommendation generation
- [ ] Support for multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Responsive web interface
- [ ] Efficient data storage and retrieval

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Player Name Validation**: Prevent typos from breaking draft flow
2. **Modular Architecture**: Split large files into focused modules
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery
4. **Configuration**: Environment-based settings
5. **Logging**: Proper debug and audit trails

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database**: Continue with SQLite for simplicity, plan for PostgreSQL migration
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with clear resource naming
- **Frontend**: Start with server-rendered templates, plan for SPA migration
- **Testing**: pytest for backend, Jest for frontend
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for consistency

## 📅 Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 (Days 1-3): Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
