# Fantasy Football Draft Assistant - Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision
Build a professional-grade fantasy football draft assistant with AI-powered recommendations, clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and modern web interface.

## 📋 Current State Assessment
- ✅ Basic functionality working (CLI draft assistant)
- ✅ Research data compiled (8,997+ mock drafts, injuries, bye weeks)
- ✅ AI recommendation engine prototype
- ❌ Code needs refactoring for maintainability
- ❌ No input validation or error handling
- ❌ No tests or documentation
- ❌ No version control

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation & Code Quality (Week 1)

### 1.1 Project Structure & Git Setup
- [ ] Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Create professional directory structure
- [ ] Set up virtual environment and requirements.txt
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Push to GitHub with initial commit

### 1.2 Code Architecture Refactor
- [ ] Split monolithic draft_assistant.py into modules:
  - `models/` - Data models and database operations
  - `services/` - Business logic and AI recommendations  
  - `cli/` - Command-line interface
  - `utils/` - Helper functions and validation
- [ ] Implement clean separation of concerns
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Create configuration management

### 1.3 Input Validation & UX
- [ ] Player name autocomplete/fuzzy matching
- [ ] Typo prevention and "did you mean?" suggestions
- [ ] Input validation for all commands
- [ ] Better error messages and help system
- [ ] Command history and undo functionality

## 🧪 Phase 2: Testing & Documentation (Week 2)

### 2.1 Test Suite Development

- [ ] Data export/import functionality
- [ ] Draft replay and analysis

## 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4+)

### 4.1 Enhanced AI
- [ ] Machine learning model for better predictions
- [ ] Historical draft pattern analysis
- [ ] Custom strategy rule configuration
- [ ] Trade value calculator integration
- [ ] Waiver wire recommendations

### 4.2 Data Integration
- [ ] Live API feeds for real-time player data
- [ ] Automated injury report updates
- [ ] Mock draft scraping and analysis
- [ ] Expert ranking aggregation
- [ ] News sentiment analysis

### 4.3 Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Cloud deployment (AWS/Heroku)
- [ ] Database migration system
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] Zero linting errors
- [ ] Type hints on all functions
- [ ] Documentation for all public APIs
- [ ] Clean git history with semantic commits

### User Experience  
- [ ] Zero-typo player entry (autocomplete)
- [ ] Sub-second recommendation generation
- [ ] Intuitive command interface
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Mobile-friendly web interface

### Performance
- [ ] <100ms database queries
- [ ] <500ms AI recommendation generation
- [ ] Support for multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Responsive web interface
- [ ] Efficient data storage and retrieval

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Player Name Validation**: Prevent typos from breaking draft flow
2. **Modular Architecture**: Split large files into focused modules
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure and recovery
4. **Configuration**: Environment-based settings
5. **Logging**: Proper debug and audit trails

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database**: Continue with SQLite for simplicity, plan for PostgreSQL migration
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with clear resource naming
- **Frontend**: Start with server-rendered templates, plan for SPA migration
- **Testing**: pytest for backend, Jest for frontend
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for consistency

## 📅 Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 (Days 1-3): Foundation
- Git setup and project structure
- Core module refactoring
- Basic input validation

### Sprint 2 (Days 4-6): Quality
- Comprehensive test suite
- Documentation and docstrings
- CI/CD pipeline setup

### Sprint 3 (Days 7-9): Web Interface
