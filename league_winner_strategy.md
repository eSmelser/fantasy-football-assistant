# League Winner Strategy - 2024 Champion Insights
*"Real advice from someone who just won with money on the line"*

## League Format Confirmed ✅
- **12 team redraft league, snake draft, full PPR**
- **Standard roster**: 1 QB, 2RB, 2WR, 1TE, 1D, 1K, 1 FLEX (WR/TE/RB)
- **Bench**: 7 spots
- **Standard scoring otherwise**

## Position Management Strategy

### **Quarterback Strategy**
- **Most people roster 2 QBs**
- **If you have a stud QB, 1 QB makes more sense**
- **Logic**: Elite QB1 doesn't need backup, use bench spot elsewhere

### **Tight End Strategy**  
- **Most people roster 1-2 TEs**
- **Streaming is common** - add/drop weekly based on matchups
- **If you have elite TE (Kelce, Andrews), 1 TE is fine**

### **Defense & Kicker**
- **Only roster 1 D and 1 K** (obviously)
- **Stream both positions** - add/drop weekly for matchups
- **Don't waste early picks on these positions**

## Advanced Draft Strategy

### **Position Scarcity Management**
> *"If you feel weak at a certain position during a draft, hammer that position with bench spots"*

**Example**: 
- **Missed top RBs early?** → Draft 4+ bench RBs late
- **Weak at WR?** → Stack WRs on bench
- **Strategy**: Hope one becomes a starter, then you're set

### **Bye Week Management**
> *"Try not to get players at the same position with the same bye week if you can help it, but not a dealbreaker"*

**Priority Order**:
1. **Draft best available talent first**
2. **Consider bye weeks as tiebreaker**
3. **Don't reach for worse player just for bye week**

**Danger Weeks to Avoid Stacking**:
- **Week 8**: 6 teams off (Byepocalypse)
- **Week 10**: 4 teams off
- **Week 14**: Playoff week - avoid if possible

## Roster Construction Philosophy

### **Bench Allocation (7 spots)**
**Typical Breakdown**:
- **1 Backup QB** (if starter isn't elite)
- **3-4 RBs** (position scarcity + injury prone)  
- **2-3 WRs** (depth plays)
- **0-1 backup TE** (stream if no elite TE)

### **Late Round Strategy**
**Rounds 10+**:
- **Target handcuff RBs** to your starters
- **High-upside rookies** at RB/WR
- **Injury-prone players** with upside
- **Don't draft K/DEF until final 2 rounds**

## Draft Day Execution Tips

### **During the Draft**
1. **Monitor bye weeks** but don't obsess
2. **If weak at position, hammer it late**
3. **Target your starter's handcuffs**
4. **Watch for breakout candidates**

### **Post-Draft Management**
- **Stream K/DEF weekly**
- **Monitor waiver wire for breakouts**
- **Trade depth for upgrades mid-season**
- **Always be working the wire**

## League Winner's Warning Signs

### **Red Flags to Avoid**
- **Too many same-bye players at same position**
- **Drafting K/DEF before Round 15**
- **Not having enough RB depth**
- **Ignoring handcuffs completely**

### **Success Indicators**
- **Strong starting lineup Rounds 1-6**
- **Position depth where you're weak**
- **Multiple lottery tickets late**
- **Flexibility to make trades**

## 2025-Specific Applications

### **Given Current Rankings**
**If you miss early RBs**:
- Target: Nick Chubb, Derrick Henry, Breece Hall
- Handcuffs: Kenneth Gainwell, Justice Hill, etc.
- Rookies: Late round fliers with opportunity

**WR Depth Strategy**:
- Slot receivers get PPR boost
- Target: Dontayvion Wicks, Quentin Johnston types
- Volume > big plays in PPR

### **Bye Week Specific to 2025**
**Week 8 is brutal** - if you take Gibbs + Jeanty + Nacua, you're in trouble
**Week 14 playoff impact** - CMC + Nabers stack risky for playoffs

## Bottom Line
*"Don't overthink it - draft talent first, manage bye weeks second, hammer weak positions late, and work the wire all season"*

**The champion's philosophy**: Value > everything, but be smart about roster construction
